# Phoenix :: Spontz demo Engine
Welcome to the infamous Phoenix :: Spontz demoengine. Be aware that each line of this code has been written with tons of suffering and [untamed indomitus nighly] pain. Please take into consideration that this could (would) extent to you if you decide to take a look.

This demo engine is an old piece of software that has undergone several heavy updates since its original C version. We have released about twenty demos with it. Main efforts come from:

* Kolian: The main developer of the original 'Inferno/Dragon' Spontz demoengine.
* Spöntz members: isaac2, Khrome, merlucin, madgoblin, shotgan, xphere.

This engine would not exist without inspiration obtained from the following sources. Thanks!
