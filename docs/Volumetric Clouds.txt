CPU:
---------------------------
1) Render a six sided cube in world space as the drawing primitive make sure to use depth culling.
PERE: Does it means backface Culling?  See: https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Face-culling
	glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
	glCullFace(GL_BACK);
	glFrontFace(GL_CW); 

Vertex shader:
---------------------------
2) In the vertex shader store off the world position of the vertices (this will interpolate per fragmet)

Fragment shader:
---------------------------
3) Use the interpolated position minus the camera position to get the vector of traversal through the volume.
4) Use a while loop to step through the volume from the point on the cube through the other side. 3 ways to know when to end.
	A) at each step test if the point is still in the cube.
	B) do a ray intersection with cube and calculate the distance between the intersections.
	C) do a prerender of the cube with forward face culling and store the depths into a second texture map then just sampe at the screen pixel to get the distance.

5) accumulate while you loop and set the pixel color.
