==============================================================

Instructions fusilated and adapted from here:

Download sources
----------------
To be able to load 3D models with the pre-made project we need Assimp library.
Authors of this library don’t distribute binary files. Therefore, we have to
build it from given source files. You can download Assimp’s source files from 
the original page (http://www.assimp.org/). Then just simply click the Download
button, and you will be redirected to their download page. Then, go ahead and
download Source code (zip).

At the time, when this article was written, the newest version of Assimp was 4.1.0.


Building Assimp
---------------
When we have downloaded the source files, we can extract them. Now, in the location
where the extracted files are, create new folder and call it build. This folder will
contain the CMake generated Visual Studio files.


Create Visual Stusio using command line
Simply open command line tool inside the newly created build directory and type:

cmake -G "Visual Studio 15" -DLIBRARY_SUFFIX="" ..

And that’s it. Generated Visual Studio solution files should be inside the build folder.

or.... use the BAT file that is provided :)

Building binaries
-----------------
If you generated Visual Studio solution files using one of the above methods, go to
the build folder and open Assimp.sln. Then, right click on the assimp project and select
Set as StartUp project.

Now select the build configuration to Release and platform to Win32 and build the project
(press F7 or choose Build->Build solution).

You should see something like:
"========== Build: 8 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 7 skipped =========="

One more step
-------------
When you have successfully built Assimp binaries, you can do the following steps:

- Copy assimp.lib from build_XX/code/Release to lib/libXX folder of our Demo project.
- Create dlls/dllXX folder in the root directory of our Demo project.
- Copy assimp.dll from build_XX/code/Release to dlls/dllXX folder of our Demo project.
- Copy build_XX/include/assimp folder to include folder of our Demo project.
- Copy include/assimp folder to include folder of our Demo project.

That’s it. We can now proceed build the engine with the new Assimp libraries!
